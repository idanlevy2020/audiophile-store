            As the headphones all others are measured against, the XX99
            Mark I demonstrates over five decades of audio expertise,
            redefining the critical listening experience. This pair of
            closed-back headphones are made of industrial,
            aerospace-grade materials to emphasize durability at a
            relatively light weight of 11 oz.

            From the handcrafted microfiber ear cushions to the robust
            metal headband with inner damping element, the components
            work together to deliver comfort and uncompromising sound.
            Its closed-back design delivers up to 27 dB of passive
            noise cancellation, reducing resonance by reflecting sound
            to a dedicated absorber. For connectivity, a specially
            tuned cable is included with a balanced gold connector.
